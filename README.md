Question of problems to solve
Exercise 01: Write a program to find the length of the variable name
	Variable, name = ”Hello there”
Exercise 02: Write a program to find the type of the variable name
	name = ”Hello there”
Exercise 03: Write a function that takes 2 numbers as arguments (age of two brothers) and find who is elder
Exercise 04: Write a program to find the index of 7
	numbers = [3,5,1,9,7,2,8]
Exercise 05: Write a program to sort the numbers in Ascending order
	numbers = [3,5,1,9,7,2,8]
Exercise 06: Write a function named “isLandscape” that takes 2 numbers (image width and height) as arguments and the function returns Landscape if the image width has a higher value than height. Returns Portrait otherwise.
Exercise 07: FizzBuzz Exercise
	Write a function that takes 1 number as argument. The function should return “Fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, the function should return “Buzz” if the number is divisible by 5, the function should return “FizzBuzz” if the number is divisible by both 5 and 3, 	otherwise return “Not a Fizz-Buzz number”.
Exercise 08: Guessing game
	Write a function that takes a number 1 to 9 from the user input (use input function inside a function). Store a number in a variable (let’s assume 6). If the input value is less than the variable, print (your guess is almost there), if the input value is greater than the variable, print – your guess is higher, if the input value and variable are equals, print – Your guess is Correct!
Exercise 09: Find if 6 available in the list [4,8,7,4,3,6,2,1,9]
